Question 2.4 

If such situation happened I would first: 
 
1. Correct the mistake by replacing all "true","yes" and "vrai" values by the originally intended value input "True" using appropriate script. 
2. Go back to the file and fix such problem to avoid repeating same mistake in the future by allowing only valid "True" value can be accepted as input.
